# Student Email Classifier 📧

This project is a **Machine Learning-based Email Classifier** that predicts whether a student’s email falls into categories such as *academic, spam, personal, or other*. It demonstrates the use of text preprocessing, feature extraction (TF-IDF), and classification models using scikit-learn.

---

## 🚀 Features

* Clean and preprocess raw email text
* Extract features using TF-IDF vectorization
* Train a classifier (Logistic Regression / Decision Tree / KNN)
* Evaluate performance with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
* Predict category for new email text
